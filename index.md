I am a post-doc in [Dr. Xihong Lin's](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/) lab at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I received my PhD in May 2020 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Department of [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) under the direction of [Dr. Michael Love](http://mikelove.github.io/) and [Dr. Danyu Lin](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/danyu-lin-phd/). I develop statistical methods for the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data and specialize in integrative analyses. I recently worked as a Graduate Research Assistant for the Biostatistics Core at the [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://unclineberger.org/).

In 2019-2020 I served as the student chair of the [NC ASA Scholastic Council](https://community.amstat.org/northcarolina/initiatives/scholasticcouncil). I received a B.S. in both Mathematics and Statistics with a minor in Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu) in May 2014. In December 2017, I received my M.S. degree in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the direction of Dr. Gary Koch.
